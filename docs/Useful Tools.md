Here's a helpful list of tools that I use quite frequently. If you have anything you wanna add, feel free!  
  
## [DIM](https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/)  
  
A *very* useful tool for inventory management and other things. You can swap weapons between your vault and character with ease and also keep track of different loadouts. I use it to tag things for junk/infusion as well as detailed item comparisons.  
  
## [Destiny Raid Report](https://raid.report)  
  
Great for giving out detailed information and stats on the raids you've done.  
  
## [Destiny Dungeon Report](https://dungeon.report)  
  
Same as above, but for dungeons instead  
  
## [Today in Destiny](https://todayindestiny.com/)  
  
Gives out very useful information about activities in the current rotations. Gives details as to surges, modifiers, and even loot tables.  
  
## [Where is Xur?](https://whereisxur.com/)  
  
Tells you the location of Xur and what's in stock.  
  
## [D2 Checklist](https://www.d2checklist.com/home)  
  
Lets you know your current progress on things like Triumphs and what activities you haven't done for the week yet. It's nice to keep track of specific things that you might not be able to see easily in game.  
  
## [Destiny Optimizer](https://destinyoptimizer.com/)  
  
Great tool when you're not at the pinnacle cap that'll help you keep track of what gear you need to get there.  
  
## [Destiny Tracker](https://destinytracker.com/)  
  
Really useful for finding detailed information on PvE and PvP events you've done like k/d and such.  
  
## [Light GG](https://www.light.gg/)  
  
Hella useful for checking on weapon rolls, a searchable index of all weapons in the game that can be filtered, and much more.  
  
## [Time Wasted on Destiny](https://wastedondestiny.com/)  
  
Really this is just to see how much of your life you've lost to the game.  
  
## [Mobalytics](https://mobalytics.gg/destiny-2/)  
  
A great community resource of different builds per class and subclass. It's super useful if you want different build ideas and inspiration for your own builds.
