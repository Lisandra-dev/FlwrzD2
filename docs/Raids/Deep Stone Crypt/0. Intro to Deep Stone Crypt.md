## Mechanics  
  
DSC builds upon a few mechanics throughout the raid. These are primarily through color coded augments (roles) you can pick up through terminals.  
  
They are:  
  
> [!columns|clean no-t flex 3 ]  
>  
> > [!note|clean no-title ctr txt-c]  
> > ![[../../../Attachments/DSC Images/operator.png|operator |90]]  
> > **Operator**  
> > Shoots things like panels  
>  
> > [!note|clean no-title ctr txt-c]  
> > ![[../../../Attachments/DSC Images/scanner.png|scanner|90]]  
> > **Scanner**  
> > Looks for glowing points of interest  
>  
> > [!note|clean no-title ctr txt-c]  
> > ![[../../../Attachments/DSC Images/suppressor.png|suppressor|90]]  
> > **Suppressor**  
> > Stands under drones and shoots a boss or two  
  
These are dropped by vandal hackers that will appear with the symbol of the augment appearing over their head. Guardians will also have these symbols above them when picked up.  
  
Augments are swapped between various terminals throughout each encounter, there are typically three within reach at any time.
