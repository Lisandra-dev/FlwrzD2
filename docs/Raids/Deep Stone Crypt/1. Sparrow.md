## Notes  
  
### Team Setup  
  
There is none really. This one is pretty straightforward.  
  
### Details  
  
It's easy to get lost here! Be careful.  
  
Dying is a bit rough in this one as the ghost of the dead guardian will appear *at the last dome that was cleared* so keep that in mind.

### Loadouts  
  
Nothing specific. Just bring enough to kill the few Fallen that'll show up in the domes.

## Don't Freeze to Death!  
  
The encounter starts with guardians clearing adds in one of the areas of Europa.  
  
Once they're dead, an area will open up where you get on your sparrow and go through a winding tunnel until you get to an area surrounded by an orange dome.  
  
â€”  
  
Guardians will need to navigate their way from dome to dome until they reach the end.  
  
  
Really the biggest thing here is making sure you follow the glowing posts along the way that guide you to the next area.

Other than that, there's not much else to it. Here's a map I found if it helps.
