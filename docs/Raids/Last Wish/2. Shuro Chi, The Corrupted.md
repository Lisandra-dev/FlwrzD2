## Notes  
  
### Team Setup  
  
Guardians should divide into two different sets of roles  
- Three to shoot almond lasers  
- Four for the puzzles  
  
For the puzzle, each guardian should be designated a number, i.e Guardian A says they're number 1, B says they're 2, etc.  
  
> [!sherpa] Sherpa Notes  
> For New Lights, I typically assign them to both the almonds and the puzzles so they get experience with both.  
  
### Details  
  
The encounter takes place over three floors.  
 - Two almonds, one puzzle for the first two floors.  
 - Two almonds for the third.  
  
You can use the rocks on the right (facing the door) to sneak up to the encounter area to give better visual examples.  
  
### Loadouts  
  
Loadout should be geared towards add clear and close range dps. Swords can be a bit finicky here so be cautious.

## Part 1: Almonds  
  
The encounter starts when everyone is in front of the door. Watch out for the **big boop**!  
  
Upon entering, a 4 minute timer titled **Shuro Chi's Song** will begin. When finishes her song, you wipe.  
  
A ton of adds will spawn, maybe try to befriend them this time? See things from their perspective? Or just kill them if you want to be lame.  
  
Once they are dead, a message will appear saying **Shuro Chi's Tempo Quickens**, causing the timer to count down faster (2 seconds off the timer for every actual second).  
  
....Shit.  
  
—  
  
At this point, almonds will spawn on the three plates surrounding Shuro Chi.  
  
The team of three guardians will grab their respective almonds, do a countdown, and jump on the plates *at the same time*. This isn't mechanically necessary but standing on the plates for too long will **kill** you.  
  
Once on the plates, guardians will point their almond to the guardian on their right and fire, forming a laser triangle around Shuro Chi. This will break her shield and allow DPS.  
  
Do as much damage to her as you can, but damage is gated to 1/6 of her health per plate.  
  
After, she will move to the next plate where the adds + almond process will repeat once more.

> When the raid first started, it was sometimes necessary to use a taken orb dropped by a knight to interrupt Shuro Chi to get some more damage in. This is no longer the case.  
  
Now it's puzzle time.

## Part 2: Puzzles  
  
> [!careful]+ Watch the Clock!  
>  
> The timer is still going, bear that in mind. If for some reason the timer is too low when you get here, (let's say less than a minute), it's probably safest to wipe.  
  
Upon defeating Shuro Chi at her second plate, guardians will move into a room with a grid of *nine plates* and *three screens*.  
  
Each screen has an image divided into nine parts that each correspond to a plate.  
  
Plates are ordered from top to bottom, left to right.  
  
> [!careful] Perspective Issue!  
>  
> The order of plates is based on the screen you are facing. The top will always be the side closest to the screen.  
  
—  
  
The team of four guardians will each stand by a plate that matches a missing piece on the screen.  
  
The guardian who said they were number one will stand by the first plate, number two by the second, etc.  
  
They will then call out when they're by their plate by saying "\[number] ready". Again, this is top to bottom, left to right.  
  
![[../../../Attachments/LW Images/SC_plate.png|center|Example of puzzles]]  
  
After a countdown, each guardian will jump on their respective plate. This will fill in the missing pieces on the screen.  
  
This process repeats two more times going clockwise (left, middle, right).  
  
> [!careful] Hot Plate!  
>  
> Guardians cannot stand on the same plate twice, regardless of perspective. In the event this happens, someone will need to switch with them.  
>  
> *This also includes trying to jump on and off the same plate.*  
  
Completing the puzzles extends the timer, so that's good.

After this, jump up to the next floor (watch out for the annoying platforms that rotate) and do the almond + puzzles again.  
  
The third floor is the final dps encounter with just the almonds.  
  
Shuro Chi has been vanquished. Hell yeah.  
  
After a jumping puzzle, head to [[./3. Morgeth, the Spirekeeper|Morgeth]]
