## Notes  
  
### Team Setup  
  
As guardians are randomly selected to carry **Riven's Heart**, there is no pretedermined team.  
  
However, the first person teleported *must always be the one to take the last blight to extend the timer*.  
  
### Details  
  
Parts 1 and 2 take place simultaneously. Be prepared for any New Lights to get super anxious. Hell, I *still* get fucking nervous during this.  
  
Like Morgeth, taken blights here will give you the **Taken Strength** debuff which will kill you if you take more than two stacks of it.  
  
This is useful to know for whoever goes inside Riven's Heart and accidentally picks one up.  
  
The debuff goes away between each chosen teleporting in.  
  
### Loadouts  
  
Add clear and survivability, that's it!

## Part 1: The Relay  
  
Prior to the encounter starting, one lucky guardian will receive a buff called **Fate's Chosen**. Only the chosen can pick up the heart, which starts the encounter with a 15 second timer.  
  
Immediately upon starting, all guardians must begin to take the heart through previous areas of the raid to a specific location.

>  
> Whoever holds the heart will have a dome surrounding them. Guardians must stay inside this in order to keep stacks of Creeping Darkness from building. Too many stacks of this will kill a guardian.

After 15 seconds is up, the guardian and anyone inside the bubble will get teleported to [[6 - Riven's Heart#Part 2 Blights and Timers|inside Riven's Heart]].  
  
*You only want the chosen to get teleported*.  
  
The chosen should announce their countdown when it reaches about 7 seconds.  
  
It's best practice to have the chosen stop at the end of Riven's mouth and have the other guardians back out of the way.

The chosen buff then gets passed to another random guardian who will then take **The Heart**.  
  
Continue along the path, keeping an eye on the timer and announcing the countdown as mentioned above as the new chosen will get teleported as well when the timer runs out.  
  
From here on out the timer will be extended 15 seconds once per chosen via those who were teleported. There will now need to be *two* countdown announcements. More on that below.  
  
At the end of the second countdown, guardians should step away from the chosen so they don't get teleported.  
  
—  
  
When you reach the areas from the Vault encounter, one path on either the left or right will be open. The path that opens changes each run, so be careful. Other guardians might be able to run ahead and see which route is open.  
  
Once you get to the Stairs area, there will be a transporter to take the chosen down to where the goal is.  
  
Meanwhile...

## Part 2: Blights and Timers  
  
So you were the first chosen to get teleported. Congrats. You have a *very* important job.  
  
When you spawn in, there will be a ton of adds. At some point, a taken blight will appear a la Morgeth which gives the **Taken Strength** debuff.  
  
**DO NOT** touch the blight just yet. Your job here is to wait for the countdown of the chosen to reach *about 3 seconds* before you grab the blight to extend the relay timer by 15 seconds. This blight will not respawn.

> It is the responsibility of the first chosen to always take the last blight to extend the timer.  
>  
> It is best practice for the first chosen to call dibs on a single blight and monitor it for the timer countdown. Other guardians must take all other blights except that one.  
>  
> The timer can only be reset once per chosen, after which the debuff will disappear and new blights spawn when the next person enters.  
  
> [!lookatthis] An Example  
>  
> - The first chosen, Guardian A, waits until the countdown timer hits 3 seconds before taking the blight.  
> - This blight will not respawn causing the next chosen, Guardian B, to teleport inside when the next timer ends.  
> - Two blights will spawn.  
> - Guardian A will claim one blight to watch over while Guardian B immediately takes the other.  
> - When the timer hits 3 seconds again, Guardian A will take their blight, extending the timer.  
> - Again, these blights will not respawn causing Guardian C to enter when the next timer ends.  
> - Repeat this process until the relay is done.  
  
As mentioned above, these blights function the same as with Morgeth, meaning you can take **no more than two stacks of Taken Strength at a time**.  
  
This is honestly kind of a good thing here in case shit gets real. I can't tell you how many times an orb has spawned on top of me and I have to panic.
