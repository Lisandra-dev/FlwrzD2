## Notes  
  
### Team Setup  
  
Honestly there's not much here in terms of setup. Everyone is kinda on their own.  
  
### Details  
  
There are six symbols in center of the room in three groups of two  
  
Each symbol corresponds to a plate around the room with a matching symbol above it.  
  
The symbols are above a series of doors. This will be important later.

There are nine total plates, each one divided into three parts.

### Loadouts  
  
Best weapons would be some form of add clear (autorifles and fusions for example) and your choice of power packing heavy (I prefer Lament personally)

## Part 1: Plate Cleansing  
  
All Guardians must choose a plate that matches one of the six symbols in the center. Stepping on a plate starts the encounter.  
  
Taken orbs will spawn on 2/3 of the plate. ***Stand on the empty part*** lest you really want to die.  
  
Adds will spawn in the meantime, as is tradition.  
  
Kalli may decide to pay you a visit. She's very rude.  
  
The empty part will randomly change after a certain amount of time. Move to the new empty part (or again, you'll die).

Soon enough, the taken orbs will disappear and a knight will spawn. **Kill the knight**, as killing them allows the door to open beneath Kalli during dps.  
  
After you murder the shit out of it, move towards the center.  
  
----  
  
## Part 2: Doors and DPS  
  
After some time, a message will appear saying **Kalli conceives an ontological weapon.** She will then move underneath one of the groups of 2 symbols above a set of doors  
  
As soon as she does this, murder the ever loving shit out of her.  
  
If you're lucky, she dies here. If not, a message will appear saying **Kalli prepares to wield her weapon**. You might also start to hear some chanting from her. She will also raise her arms as she does this. Scary.

At this point, a fun game of musical chairs begins as underneath her, six doors open  
  
> [!careful] Why Aren't There Enough Doors?!  
>  
> If a knight wasn't killed, one of the doors won't open. This is bad.  
  
  
  
![[../../assets/img/Kalli_doors.jpg|open doors]]  
  
  
  
Each guardian has about 10 seconds to enter one of the open doors and hide in the little room. One guardian per door. No sharing.  
  
After the doors close, a huge wave of energy will wash over the field and the doors will reopen. If you do not enter a room **you will die**.  
  
Guardians should exit and find Kalli below another set of symbols. Continue dps.  
  
> [!alt] Alternative Method  
> Some people like to number the open rooms 1-6 from top to bottom. To me, musical chairs is more fun. This mattered more when the raid first came out.  
  
This should be enough to finish Kalli off, however if for some reason it doesn't she will begin to prepare her weapon again, and more doors will open. This can happen a total of three times, one per each section.

If for some ungodly reason she isn't dead by now, the process starts over from the top (matching new symbols, cleansing plates, etc.)  
  
Kalli is dead. Congrats.
