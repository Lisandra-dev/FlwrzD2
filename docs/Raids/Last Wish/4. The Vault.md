## Notes  
  
### Team Setup  
  
Three readers / runners  
Three defenders  
  
> [!sherpa] Sherpa Notes  
> If there are enough New Lights, you can get them to swap at different phases so everyone gets a chance to do everything.  
  
### Details  
  
Zones are designated as Stairs, Trees, Rocks. They are all connected via tunnels. Scope those out ahead of time to get a feel for them.  
  
Remember: Penumbra is left, Antumbra is right  
  
All six guardians will stay in the center (except for one runner of course) with one runner and one defender per plate.  
  
Once again, Penumbra is left, Antumbra is right.  
  
### Loadouts  
  
Loadout is whatever works best for add clear. Maybe a sword for knights.

## Part 1: Hooked on Phonics  
  
Before we actually start things, let's go over how the reading actually works.  
  
There is a large machine in the middle, with a plate in front of each zone. Each plate has three screens in front of it. When the actual encounter starts, each screen will show a symbol.  
  
 ![[../../../Attachments/LW Images/Vault.png|center]]  
  
The guardian on Stairs will start by describing the ***symbol in the middle***. For example they might say "I have a cloud snake".  
  
Whoever is on Trees or Rocks will have this symbol on their left or right. They will call out their zone and the location of the symbol and say something like "Trees left", which would make them Penumbra , or "Rocks right", making them Antumbra.  
   
That person will then read *their* center symbol, and another will respond with their location and direction of the symbol, again, something like "Stairs right!".  
   
To be safe, all sides should be called out. You can typically get away with only calling out two though.  
   
There is no specific order for who gets Penumbra or Antumbra.  
  
Also in case it needs repeating: **Penumbra is left, Antumbra is right**  
  
  
> [!lookatthis] An Example!  
> 1. Stairs calls out their center symbol as 8 snake.  
> 2. Trees sees this on their left and notes they are Penumbra by saying "Trees left".  
> 3. Trees calls out that their center symbol is cloud snake.  
> 4. Rocks sees this on their right and notes they are Antumbra by saying "Rocks right"  
> 5. Rock sees their middle symbol is infinity snake  
> 6. Since Stairs is the only one left, they see this on their right and notes they are also Antumbra by saying "Stairs right"  
>  
Note: It is best to have someone record all of this down by either writing it chat like:  
> `Trees Ant` or `TA`  
> `Stairs Pen` or `SP`  
or just use the website I mentioned in the intro. Up to you.  
  
Now that the *basic intro* is done with, let's actually get shit started.  
  
----  
  
## Part 2: Reading and Running  
  
Now, to start the actual encounter, we begin by all three readers stepping on their plates.  
  
Make sure to be timely as the entrances to two of the zones will close off with one remaining open. *Call out which one is open*. These will close and open on their own and care not for the folly of guardians. Taking too long can make communication chaotic and stressful because of this.  
  
—  
  
The guardians by that specific zone will then begin to add clear. Over time, an **Eye of Riven** will appear. Like with Morgeth, when it dies it will drop an orb.  
  
Killing **The Eye of Riven** closes off the wall to the room it was in and causes another to open.  
  
*Make sure whoever is on defense returns to the middle before this happens*.  
  
The runner then picks up the orb and books it.  
  
> [!careful] Watch the Buff!  
>  
> Pay attention to the buff from the orb! It will say either Penumbra or Antumbra. Remember this from earlier? Yeah... it's important.  
  
—  
  
Another callout needs to happen to tell the runner which area to exit from.  
  
> [!deadly] The Sword in the Stone!  
> During this time, a knight will spawn from one of the rooms. It's goal is not to attack you, but book it for the plate in front of it and stab it. If it's there for too long, that's a wipe. See now why the defenders are here?  
  
Once the runner makes it, they will dunk the orb *using the grenade button* on the plate that matches the buff. For example, if Stairs marked themselves as Antumbra, and the runner has the Antumbra buff, they can deposit it there.  
  
To reiterate, **The buff needs to match the plate callout.**  
  
This will repeat two more times to cover the remaining plates and unlock one part of the security system.  
  
> [!careful] Why are there more?!  
>  
> So remember the sword plunging knight from earlier? Yeah... for each subsequent plate that needs the buff, an additional knight will spawn. Think of it as matching numbers.  
> - First plate spawns one knight  
> - Second plate spawns two knights  
> - Third plate three.  
  
After all three plates have their respective buffs, we do this two more times and it's done!
