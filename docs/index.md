## Well heya. I'm Mister Flowers. Fledgling sherpa and Titan main.

## About Me  
  
Good day Guardian! I'm not some pro player or some big shot. My main goal here is to help others out on their journeys to learn more about Destiny 2 and have fun while doing so.  
  
I want to bring a kinder and more patient mentality to the field while also teaching you in a way that works best for you.  
  
My guides here might be a bit silly, but I truly hope they help.  
  
> [!tip] My Teaching Tenets!  
>  
> - Patience and compassion first and foremost. Raids can already be anxiety inducing enough, being impatient and angry will only be harmful.  
>  
>  
> - Wipes are encouraged! Even if you just want to start an encounter to see how the beginning of it works or if someone just can't quite get the mechanics, we're here to teach for a reason! Expecting a crew of New Lights to get a raid done in an hour is unrealistic.  
>  
>  
> - Let the New Lights decide what they want to do. Too many times I've been put on add clear and not taught anything I wanted to learn. The players themselves should decide what role to take and what they're most comfortable with.  
>  
>  
> - Suggestions, not strict requirements. For certain encounters, different types of weapons might be necessary like in situations where a boss can't be hit by a sword or where a sniper won't be good because the boss will be five feet in front of you. However, I will not ever talk down to a player for not having Thunderlord or something like that. If they have it, great! If not, we'll work around it.

## Guide Key  
  
Often times you'll see me use fun boxes for things like warnings and notes. Here's what they represent.

> > [!careful] Be Careful!  
> > Keep an eye out for something important going on  
>  
> > [!deadly] Death Abound!  
> > You might wipe from this!  
>  
> > [!sherpa] Sherpa Notes  
> > My thoughts on guiding New Lights.  
>  
> > [!alt] Alternative Method  
> > Not every party does things the same! Let's look at other options.  
>  
> > [!lookatthis] Just a Thought!  
> > These are usually just notes and other fun facts.  
>  
> > [!tldr] tl;dr  
> > A basic summary of what's going on.
